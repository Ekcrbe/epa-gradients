# EPA Gradients

A static, GitHub Pages–hosted visualizer for the FIRST Robotics Competition. For
each region it shows how **locally competitive difficulty compares to the
worldwide baseline as a function of team skill**, using historical
[Statbotics](https://www.statbotics.io/) EPA.

## The idea

EPA (Expected Points Added) is Statbotics' team rating. Using the **unitless**
EPA (an Elo-style, cross-season-comparable scale, ~1500 average), we compare each
region's skill distribution against the worldwide one at every skill level.

**Primary metric — percentile displacement.** With `F_global`/`F_region` the CDFs
of team strength and `Q_global` the global quantile function, on a global
percentile axis `p`:

```
D(p) = p − F_region( Q_global(p) )
```

`D(p) > 0` → the region ranks a team of that skill lower than the world does
(locally *harder*); `D(p) < 0` → *easier*. The zero-crossing is where a region
flips from easier to harder. A secondary **survival ratio**
`R(x) = (1 − F_region(x)) / (1 − F_global(x))` (log axis, tail-capped) probes the
elite tail where percentile differences compress.

A team's strength entering season *S* is a linear-recency **weighted moving
average** (weights 4:3:2:1) of its unitless EPA over the four prior seasons
`S-4…S-1`, with the canceled 2020/2021 seasons dropped and weights renormalized.

## Architecture

Two clean layers:

1. **Offline Python pipeline** (`pipeline/`) — fetches EPA, assigns regions,
   computes WMA strengths, CDFs, `D(p)`, survival ratios, summary stats, and
   bootstrap confidence bands, then writes static JSON into `docs/data/`.
2. **Static frontend** (`docs/`) — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + vendored D3. Reads only
   the precomputed JSON; **never** calls an API at runtime (no CORS, rate limits,
   or runtime failures).

All EPA fetching happens once and is cached under `data/raw/`, so the statistics
and the site can be iterated without re-hitting any API.

## Data sources

- **≤ 2023:** the `v3/team_years.csv` table from a pinned commit of
  [`avgupta456/statbotics-csvs`](https://github.com/avgupta456/statbotics-csvs)
  (has `unitless_epa` back to 2002).
- **2024–2026:** the Statbotics mirror API
  (`https://api-statbotics.iterativerefinement.com/v3`), paginated and cached.
  2024 is taken from the API rather than the pinned CSV because that commit's
  2024 EPAs were still mid-season and compressed toward the mean.

## Repository layout

```
config/settings.toml   Pipeline configuration (pinned commit, years, weights, grids)
pipeline/              Offline data pipeline (acquire → normalize → regions →
                       strength → metrics/bootstrap → emit)
data/raw/              Cached source data (committed, offline-rebuildable)
data/interim/          Regenerable intermediates (gitignored)
data/review/           Human-review artifacts (state→district map, PA team list)
docs/                  The deployed static site (GitHub Pages: main /docs)
  data/                Generated JSON artifacts consumed by the frontend
tests/                 Pipeline unit tests
```

## Build

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/python -m pip install -e .        # or: pip install numpy pandas requests pyarrow
.venv/Scripts/python -m pipeline.run            # writes docs/data/*.json
```

Add `--refresh` to re-download source data (otherwise caches are reused).

## Local preview

```bash
python -m http.server -d docs 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/
```

## Deployment

GitHub Pages is served from the `main` branch `/docs` folder. `docs/.nojekyll`
disables Jekyll processing; all asset paths are relative so the project page
works under `/epa-gradients/`.
